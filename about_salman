      <h2>My Role in the Project</h2>
      <p>
        For this milestone, my main role was to develop the introduction and key concepts sections, ensuring that the site’s structure followed clean HTML formatting and consistent CSS styling. 
        I also helped maintain visual consistency across all team pages by aligning the navigation bar, color theme, and footer structure.

      <h2>Topic: Responsive Web Design</h2>
      <p>
        My research topic focuses on <strong>Responsive Web Design</strong> — the practice of designing websites that automatically adjust layout and content for different screen sizes. 
        This approach ensures accessibility and usability across devices such as smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

        <li>Using flexible grids and layouts.</li>
        <li>Applying media queries for screen adaptability.</li>
        <li>Optimizing typography and images for performance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why This Topic Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Responsive design has become a cornerstone of modern web development. 
        It enhances user satisfaction, reduces maintenance effort, and improves SEO performance. 
        Learning it early helps build strong front-end skills and prepares developers for real-world applications.
