    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</strong> is the foundational protocol used for communication 
      between web browsers and servers as it’s essentially what makes the World Wide Web work.
    </p>

    <h2>The Birth of HTTP </h2>
    <p> HTTP was born in 1989 when <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> proposed a system for sharing hypertext documents over the internet. By 1990
      he developed four foundational components with one of them being HTTP. The first version of HTTP <strong>(HTTP/0.9)</strong> was superbly
      simple, using a single GET request to retrieve plain HTML files.
      
    </p>

    <h2>Growth and Standardization of HTTP</h2>
    <p> As the web rapidly began to expand in the 1990s, HTTP evolved from simple one-line protocol into a
      standardized framwork for global communication. HTTP's transformation from a basic documment fetcher
      into a heavily sophisticated transport system powering the digital world.
     
    </p>


    <h2>Modern HTTP/2 & HTTP/3</h2>
    <p> HTTP/2 & HTTP/3 focused on speed, security, and multiplexing, being able to adapt to the demands of modern 
      applications and high-traffic environments. 
      
    </p>

    <h2>The Evolution Table of HTTP Versions</h2>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Version</th>
        <th>Year</th>
        <th>Significant Highlights</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>HTTP/0.9</td>
        <td>1991</td>
        <td>Basic text and hyperlinks</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>HTTP/1.0</td>
        <td>1991</td>
        <td>Simple GET requests, plain HTML only</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>HTTP/1.0</td>
        <td>1996</td>
        <td>Headers, status codes, POST method</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>HTTP/1.1</td>
        <td>1997</td>
        <td>Persistent connections, aching, pipelining</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>HTTP/2</td>
        <td>2015</td>
        <td>Multiplexing, header compression, server push</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>HTTP/3</td>
        <td>2022</td>
        <td>Built on QUIC (UDP), faster and more secure</td>
      </tr>

    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>HTTP first had its origins as a simple one-line protocol only supporteing the GET method
        & was just enough to serve basic hypertext pages in a semitrusted lab environment</li>
      <li>As the age of the internet progressed so did new versions of HTTP in order to adapt to each new change.</li>
      <li>HTTP/2 is the most used version today and is often paired with HTTP/3 in modern deployments.</li>
    </ul>
