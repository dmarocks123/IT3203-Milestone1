    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</strong> is the foundational protocol used for communication 
      between web browsers and servers as it’s essentially what makes the World Wide Web work.
    </p>

    <h2>The Birth of HTTP </h2>
    <p>
      The first version of HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. It was very basic and
      supported only simple elements like paragraphs and hyperlinks. HTML 2.0, released in 1995,
      was the first standardized version. It improved browser support and introduced forms,
      which allowed basic user interaction.
    </p>

    <h2>Growth and Standardization</h2>
    <p>
      As websites became more complex, new versions of HTML were needed. HTML 3.2 was released
      in 1997 and added support for features such as tables and image alignment. Shortly after,
      HTML 4.01 arrived in 1999 and became one of the most widely used versions. It introduced
      better organization of content and worked alongside CSS to separate style from structure.
    </p>

    <h2>The XHTML Transition</h2>
    <p>
      In the early 2000s, XHTML was created as a stricter, XML-based version of HTML. The goal
      was to improve consistency and enforce cleaner coding practices. While XHTML brought
      improvements in structure, it was less flexible and eventually lost popularity as web
      developers looked for more capable and adaptable options.
    </p>

    <h2>Modern HTML5</h2>
    <p>
      HTML5, published in 2014, became the new standard for modern web development. It introduced
      support for audio, video, canvas-based graphics, and application programming interfaces
      (APIs). HTML5 also included new semantic tags, which made content more meaningful and
      improved accessibility and search engine optimization.
    </p>

    <h2>Comparison Table of HTML Versions</h2>
