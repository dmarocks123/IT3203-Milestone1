    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Responsive Web Design (RWD) is an essential part of modern web development. It ensures that websites automatically adjust their layout, images, and navigation to fit different devices — from large desktop monitors to tablets and smartphones. This flexibility helps maintain a consistent user experience regardless of screen size or orientation.
    </p>

    <h2>The Importance of Responsiveness</h2>
    <p>
      Before responsive design, web developers had to create separate desktop and mobile versions of the same site. This made maintenance difficult and often led to inconsistent designs. Responsive Web Design eliminates that problem by using flexible grids, layouts, and media queries to make one site work on all devices. As mobile internet usage continues to rise, responsive design has become a standard practice for all modern websites.
    </p>

    <h2>Core Principles of Responsive Design</h2>
    <p>
      The main goal of RWD is to make websites adaptable and user-friendly across platforms. It follows three key technical principles:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fluid Grids:</strong> Layouts are built using relative units (like percentages) instead of fixed pixels, allowing them to resize smoothly.</li>
      <li><strong>Flexible Images:</strong> Images scale within their containers, preventing overflow on smaller screens.</li>
      <li><strong>Media Queries:</strong> CSS rules that apply styles based on screen size, resolution, or orientation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Evolution of Responsive Design</h2>
    <p>
      The concept of responsive design was first popularized by Ethan Marcotte in 2010. As mobile browsing grew rapidly, developers realized that fixed-width layouts could not accommodate the variety of devices people used. Over time, frameworks like Bootstrap and CSS Grid helped standardize responsive layouts, making the development process faster and more efficient.
    </p>

    <h2>Example Table of Screen Breakpoints</h2>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Device Type</th>
        <th>Screen Width</th>
        <th>Common Layout Behavior</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Mobile</td>
        <td>up to 600px</td>
        <td>Single column layout</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Tablet</td>
        <td>601px – 1024px</td>
        <td>Two-column layout</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Desktop</td>
        <td>1025px and above</td>
        <td>Multi-column layout with sidebar</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Image Example Placeholder</h2>
    <p>
      Below is a placeholder image that can later be replaced with an actual example of a responsive layout:
    </p>
    <img src="" alt="Responsive web design layout placeholder">

    <h2>Benefits of Responsive Web Design</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Improves user experience on all devices.</li>
      <li>Reduces maintenance by using a single website instead of multiple versions.</li>
      <li>Enhances SEO ranking, as search engines favor mobile-friendly sites.</li>
      <li>Supports accessibility and usability best practices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Responsive design adapts to screen size using flexible layouts and CSS media queries.</li>
      <li>It ensures visual consistency and functionality across devices.</li>
      <li>RWD is now a required standard in professional web development.</li>
